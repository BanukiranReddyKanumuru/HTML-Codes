        <p>The best hotel I have ever been privileged enough to stay at. 
            Gorgeous building, and it only gets more breathtaking when you walk in. 
            High quality rooms (there was even a tv by the shower), and high quality service. 
            Also, they are one of few hotels that allow people under 21 to book a reservation.</p>
